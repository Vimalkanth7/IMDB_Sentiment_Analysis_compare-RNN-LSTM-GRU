âœ… A. Traditional Machine Learning Models (baseline)
You can use these with TF-IDF or Bag of Words features:

Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB / BernoulliNB)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Trees

âœ… B. Classical Deep Learning Models
ðŸ”¹ CNN-based
1D Convolutional Neural Network (TextCNN)

Works surprisingly well with embeddings for text classification.

ðŸ”¹ RNN-based
(you already used these but here's a fuller list)
9. Vanilla RNN
10. LSTM
11. GRU
12. Bidirectional RNN / LSTM / GRU
13. Stacked RNN / LSTM / GRU
14. Attention Mechanism on LSTM/GRU

âœ… C. Advanced Recurrent Architectures
Self-Attention LSTM

Hierarchical Attention Networks (HAN)

RCNN (Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network)

BiLSTM + CRF (often used in NER, but can be adapted)

âœ… D. Transformer-based Models (state-of-the-art)
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT)

DistilBERT (lighter and faster)

ALBERT (A Lite BERT)

XLNet (autoregressive model)

ELECTRA (efficient pretraining)

GPT (for classification) (with fine-tuning)

T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)

Longformer (for longer sequences)

DeBERTa (Decoder-enhanced BERT)

âœ… E. Multimodal / Specialized Models (advanced)
These are less common but interesting:

ERNIE (knowledge-enhanced transformer)

BART (for summarization + classification)

BigBird (efficient transformer for long text)

Universal Sentence Encoder + Classifier

Sentence-BERT + MLP

LaMDA / Gemini / Claude (mostly closed-source for research)

âœ… F. Embedding Approaches (as inputs to models)
GloVe Embeddings + CNN/RNN

FastText Embeddings + MLP/CNN

Word2Vec + Traditional ML / Deep Models

TF-IDF + Classifier
